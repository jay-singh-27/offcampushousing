## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development)
- Stripe account (for payment processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>

```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up Stripe:
   - Create a Stripe account at https://stripe.com

# or
yarn ios
```

## Configuration

### Stripe Setup

1. **Development**: Use Stripe test keys for development
2. **Production**: Replace with live keys before deployment

### Backend Integration

The app currently uses mock data for development. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Update API endpoints in `src/services/PaymentService.ts`
2. Implement authentication API calls in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
3. ✅ Integrated with Supabase database for real data

### Maps Configuration

The app uses React Native Maps. For iOS:
1. No additional setup required for basic functionality
2. For advanced features, configure API keys in `app.json`
